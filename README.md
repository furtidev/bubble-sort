# Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 

## How does it work?
- With the Bubble Sort algorithm, we scan the array from left to right. And if items are out of order, we swap them.
- We start off by comparing the items at index 0 & index 1. If the right item is smaller than the left item, we swap them. Because we're sorting this array in ascending order.
- After that, we compare the items at index 1 & index 2. You know what happens next. 
- This goes on and on until the array is fully sorted.
